<h2>Description</h2>
<p><strong>If you love shrimp risotto but hate all of the stirring and time involved, you'll love making it in the Instant Pot.
You'll have creamy, tender risotto, and adding some shrimp turns this into one delicious main course. Top with an
additional sprinkle of Parmesan, if desired.</strong></p>

    <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>

    <li>½ cup frozen peas, thawed</li>

</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function on normal setting according
    to manufacturer's instructions. Add 2 tablespoons butter and olive oil; stir in shallot and garlic and cook until
    softened, about 1 minute. Stir in rice and cook until coated and toasted, about 3 minutes. Add wine, scraping and
    deglazing the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon; cook until wine has evaporated, about 1 minute. Turn off Saute
    function.</li>
    <li>Stir in chicken broth, clam juice, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according
    to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
    <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, for 5 minutes. Release
    remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
    <li>While pressure is releasing on the pot, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp
    and season with paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook until shrimp are opaque, about 3 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid on
    the pressure cooker.</li>
    <li>Stir shrimp, peas, Parmesan cheese, and remaining butter into rice mixture. Divide among bowls and serve.</li>
